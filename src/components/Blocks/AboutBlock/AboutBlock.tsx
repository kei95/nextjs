          This is a testing purpose website for Kei to understand how WordPress
          works. He is now amazed how easy this one static web page can be made
          by using it.

        <p>
          He is now located in Vancouver yet always open to any kind of
          opportunity to contribute and improve his skills and gain experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you looking for somebody who can make something meaningful with
          you? You are in the right place. Send a message to him, he doesnâ€™t
          bite you!
