      <p>
        This is a testing purpose website for Kei to understand how WordPress
        works. He is now amazed how easy this one static web page can be made by
        using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is now located in Vancouver yet always open to any kind of
        opportunity to contribute and improve his skills and gain experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you looking for somebody who can make a web page for cheaper price?
        You are in the right place. Send message to him he doesnâ€™t bite you!

      <SlashSpace />
